- **Movie Details**: Detailed information about each movie is available, including the release date, overview, and more.
- **Movie Search**: A search feature will be implemented to allow users to find specific movies.

## Future Improvements

- **Add to List**: Users will be able to add movies to their watched or to-watch lists.
- **Remove from List**: Users will be able to remove movies from their lists.
